## Project Overview  
This project analyzes manufacturing downtime and operator efficiency for **Wolf Cola**, a soft drink company based in Philadelphia. The goal was to identify major causes of inefficiency, evaluate operator performance, and recommend data-driven solutions to reduce downtime and enhance productivity.


## Business Objective  
> Improve overall production line efficiency by identifying and addressing key causes of downtime and low operator performance.


## Approach & Methodology  

### 1. Data Processing & Efficiency Analysis  
- Imported raw production data and created a **Batch Time** column to measure actual production durations.  
- Used `VLOOKUP` to fetch **Minimum Batch Time** per product to calculate efficiency.  
- Computed operator efficiency:  
  \[
  \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Minimum Batch Time}}{\text{Actual Batch Time}} \times 100
  \]  
- Visualized operator performance using a bar chart:  
  - **Mac** had the lowest efficiency at **61%**, below the overall average of **64%**.

### 2. Downtime Root Cause Analysis (Pareto Chart)  
- Aggregated total downtime minutes by category and sorted in descending order.  
- Created a **Pareto Chart** to visualize the top contributors.  
- Found that **80% of total downtime** came from just **5 factors**:  
  - Machine Adjustment  
  - Machine Failure  
  - Inventory Shortage  
  - Batch Change  
  - Batch Coding Error  

### 3. Operator-Specific Downtime Breakdown  
- Built a matrix mapping downtime by operator and downtime reason.  
- Found that **3 of the top 5 downtime categories were due to operator error**.  
- Notably, **Mac** had **130 minutes of downtime** from Batch Change alone.

---

## Key Findings  
- **Mac** is the lowest-performing operator and needs targeted support.  
- **Machine adjustment** is the #1 downtime factor across all operators.  
- Operator errors contribute significantly to downtime and must be addressed.

---

## Recommendations  
1. **Machine Adjustment Training** for all operators (addresses top downtime driver).  
2. **Specialized Batch Change Training** for Mac.  
3. **Preventive Maintenance Plan** and inventory audits to reduce machine failure and shortage issues.
